**SwiftUI Gestures:**
- Long-press gesture

**SF Symbols:**
With over 3200 icons, SF Symbols is a library of iconography designed to integrate seamlessly with San Francisco, the system font for Apple platforms. New rendering modes provide greater control over how color is applied to symbols. Besides the standard Single color rendering, there is a Hierarchical rendering, a Palette rendering, and a Multicolor rendering.
